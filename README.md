# Welcome to the PlayGround üöÄ

This repository aims to store projects and experiments in computing, including Machine Learning (ML) models and other related practices. Here you will find various examples of algorithms, experiments, and tests conducted on different computational problems. üòä

## What will you find in this repository? üìÇ

This repository serves as a space for study and experimentation, with a collection of Jupyter notebooks and projects where I document the concepts I'm studying and testing. Each project is an opportunity to apply techniques, from the simplest to the most advanced.

### Main Components:

#### **Projects and Notebooks** üìì

This repository contains various projects and notebooks with algorithms and models I‚Äôm learning. Each file includes the code to implement a solution, along with explanations of how it works and the steps involved in each experiment.

#### **Datasets** üóÇÔ∏è

Some projects use public and ready-to-use datasets. These datasets allow you to test and apply different techniques without needing to search for external sources.

#### **Models and Algorithms** üß†

The repository includes everything from basic algorithms to more complex models, covering Machine Learning and other areas of computing. Each implementation is accompanied by a detailed study and improvement attempts.
